How to run the program - If not given any input arguments, the program assumes that the program of interest is located in a file called debug.txt and the input stream is located in a file called input.txt.
If given input arguments, the program assumes the first argument is the name of the file which has the program of interest and the second argument is the input stream file.
This should work even if you run the program from the command line of a different directory.
